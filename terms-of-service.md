# Terms of Service for Visera AI

**Effective Date:** April 24, 2025

Welcome to Visera AI! These Terms of Service ("Terms") govern your use of the Visera AI mobile application (the "App") provided by Visera Labs ("we," "us," or "our").

**Please read these Terms carefully before using the App. By accessing or using the App, you agree to be bound by these Terms. If you disagree with any part of the terms, then you may not access the App.**

## 1. Acceptance of Terms

By creating an account or using the App, you confirm that you accept these Terms and agree to comply with them. If you do not agree to these Terms, you must not use our App. We recommend that you print a copy of these Terms for future reference.

## 2. Changes to Terms

We reserve the right, at our sole discretion, to modify or replace these Terms at any time. If a revision is material, we will provide reasonable notice prior to any new terms taking effect, such as by updating the "Effective Date" at the top of these Terms or providing notice through the App. What constitutes a material change will be determined at our sole discretion. By continuing to access or use our App after any revisions become effective, you agree to be bound by the revised terms.

## 3. User Accounts

* **Registration:** To use certain features of the App, you must register for an account using Firebase Authentication (e.g., via Google, Apple, Twitter). You agree to provide accurate, current, and complete information during the registration process and to update such information to keep it accurate, current, and complete.
* **Account Security:** You are responsible for safeguarding the password or credentials that you use to access the App and for any activities or actions under your account. We encourage you to use "strong" passwords (passwords that use a combination of upper and lower case letters, numbers, and symbols) with your account. You agree not to disclose your password to any third party. You must notify us immediately upon becoming aware of any breach of security or unauthorized use of your account.
* **Eligibility:** You must be at least 13 years old (or the minimum age required in your jurisdiction to use the App without parental consent) to create an account and use the App.

## 4. Use of the App

* **License:** We grant you a limited, non-exclusive, non-transferable, revocable license to use the App for your personal, non-commercial purposes, subject to these Terms.
* **AI Generation:** The App allows you to submit input (text prompts, images) to generate output (images, videos) using third-party AI models (e.g., via PiAPI). Your use of these features is subject to these Terms and potentially the terms of the underlying AI service providers.
* **Service Availability:** We strive to keep the App available, but we do not guarantee that the App, or any content on it, will always be available or be uninterrupted. We may suspend, withdraw, or restrict the availability of all or any part of our App for business and operational reasons.

## 5. User Content and Generated Content

* **Your Input:** You retain ownership of the original content (text prompts, uploaded images) you submit to the App ("User Input"). However, by submitting User Input, you grant us a worldwide, non-exclusive, royalty-free license to use, copy, modify, process, and transmit your User Input solely for the purpose of providing the AI generation service to you and operating the App.
* **Generated Output:** The ownership of the images or videos generated by the AI models ("Generated Content") may be subject to the terms of the underlying AI service provider (e.g., PiAPI) and applicable law regarding AI-generated works. We make no claim of ownership over the Generated Content produced specifically for you through your use of the service. You are responsible for ensuring your use of Generated Content complies with any applicable third-party terms and laws.
* **Responsibility:** You are solely responsible for your User Input and your use of the Generated Content. You agree not to submit User Input or use Generated Content in a way that is illegal, harmful, offensive, or infringes on the rights of others.

## 6. Intellectual Property Rights

The App itself, including its source code, visual design, features, functionality, and all related intellectual property rights (excluding User Input and potentially Generated Content as described above) are and will remain the exclusive property of Visera Labs and its licensors. Our trademarks and trade dress may not be used in connection with any product or service without our prior written consent.

## 7. Prohibited Activities

You agree not to use the App:

* In any way that violates any applicable national or international law or regulation.
* For the purpose of exploiting, harming, or attempting to exploit or harm minors in any way.
* To generate or disseminate content that is illegal, harmful, fraudulent, deceptive, threatening, harassing, defamatory, obscene, or otherwise objectionable.
* To infringe upon the intellectual property rights or other rights of any third party.
* To transmit, or procure the sending of, any advertising or promotional material, including any "junk mail," "chain letter," "spam," or any other similar solicitation.
* To impersonate or attempt to impersonate Visera Labs, a Visera Labs employee, another user, or any other person or entity.
* To engage in any other conduct that restricts or inhibits anyone's use or enjoyment of the App, or which, as determined by us, may harm us or users of the App or expose them to liability.
* To reverse engineer, decompile, disassemble, or otherwise attempt to discover the source code of the App.
* To interfere with or disrupt the servers or networks connected to the App.

## 8. Third-Party Services

The App utilizes third-party services, including but not limited to Firebase Authentication and third-party AI generation APIs (e.g., PiAPI). Your use of these services through our App may be subject to the terms and conditions and privacy policies of those third parties. We are not responsible for the practices of any third-party services.

## 9. Termination

We may terminate or suspend your account and bar access to the App immediately, without prior notice or liability, under our sole discretion, for any reason whatsoever, including but not limited to a breach of these Terms.
